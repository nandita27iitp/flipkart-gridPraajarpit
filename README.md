✨"Revolutionizing Quality Testing through Computer Vision Technology"✨

## Project Description

- In fast-paced e-commerce and retail industries, maintaining high standards of product quality, accuracy, and freshness is critical for customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
- Traditional quality control methods, which rely heavily on manual inspections, are prone to human error, time-intensive, and struggle to scale effectively for large volumes of products.
- This creates challenges such as incorrect product identification, missed defects, and the shipment of expired or spoiled goods, which can lead to customer dissatisfaction, returns, and revenue loss.


Our goals is to develop an advanced smart vision system that leverages imaging technology, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) to automate quality control processes in the e-commerce industry.

## Use Cases

1. Extracting details available on packaging material - OCR to extract details from image/label
2. Expiry date validation - Using OCR to get expiry date details
3. Predicting shelf life of fresh fruits and vegetables - Detecting freshness of fresh produce

## Technologies Used

- Gemini and Mistral LLM
- Pytorch
- OpenCV
- Paddle OCR
- Yolov11
- Hardware: 1080p Monocular Camera
- Items used to train Model: Product specification images
